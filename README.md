Module 21 Challenge
File Starter_Code.ipynb is the file the code is in.
created code in Google Colab due to not being able to run on my laptop.

Three attempts to try to increase the accuracy, wasn't able to raise it above 75%

# 268/268 - 0s - loss: 0.5631 - accuracy: 0.7236 - 481ms/epoch - 2ms/step
# Loss: 0.5630577802658081, Accuracy: 0.7236151695251465

#added a third hidden layer using sigmoid.

#268/268 - 1s - loss: 0.5737 - accuracy: 0.7268 - 622ms/epoch - 2ms/step
#Loss: 0.5737234950065613, Accuracy: 0.7267638444900513

# Used 200 epoch with a small improvement

# 268/268 - 0s - loss: 0.5690 - accuracy: 0.7265 - 488ms/epoch - 2ms/step
# Loss: 0.5690232515335083, Accuracy: 0.7265306115150452

# combined the changes from last two attempts and didn't come with anything to different then with just the added extera epochs.
